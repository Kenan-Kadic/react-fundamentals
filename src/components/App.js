import React from "react";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            Hello World <br />
            My React confidence is growing now that I have done some state and props and fetched some APIs<br />
            I even made a custom hook <br />
            I called it useFetch and it combined useState with useEffect to fetch a API <br />
            There is no going back now--I will be a React Developer, God willing <br />
            Repetition makes perfect so I keep repeating <br />
        </div>
    )
}
export default App
